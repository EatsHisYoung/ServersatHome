# Welcome to the Servers@Home Github!

This space will serve as a home for select code which I want to share with the community to help beginners learn how to get comfortable in the command line.

For more info on these projects and their use, see the wiki (https://wiki.serversatho.me) or the blog (https://blog.serversatho.me).
